  <h2>The Fox & the Goat</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.
A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox,
inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry
guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was
excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat,
mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he
drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and
suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will
place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your
back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily
assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the
Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as
fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise,
he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had
as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would
never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have
exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.”</p>

  <h2>The Wolves & the Sheep</h2>

<div class="text-content">
  <p>"Why is there always this hostility between us?" they said. "If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become."
The Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away, and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of their lives.</p>

  <h2>The Goose & the Golden Egg</h2>

  <div class="main-content">
  <p>There was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine, for every day when he visited the nest, the Goose had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden egg.
The Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long before he grew impatient with the Goose because she gave him only a single golden egg a day. He was not getting rich fast enough.
Then one day, after he had finished counting his money, the idea came to him that he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did he find, and his precious Goose was dead.</p>
